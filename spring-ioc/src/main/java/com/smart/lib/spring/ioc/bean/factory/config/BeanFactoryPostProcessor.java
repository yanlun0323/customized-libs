/**
 *
 * 是由 Spring 框架组建提供的容器扩展机制，允许在 Bean 对象注册后但未实例化之前，对 Bean 的定义信息 BeanDefinition 执行修改操作
 *
 *
 * Allows for custom modification of an application context's bean definitions,
 * adapting the bean property values of the context's underlying bean factory.
 *
 * <p>Application contexts can auto-detect BeanFactoryPostProcessor beans in
 * their bean definitions and apply them before any other beans get created.
 *
 * <p>Useful for custom config files targeted at system administrators that
 * override bean properties configured in the application context.
 *
 * <p>See PropertyResourceConfigurer and its concrete implementations
 * for out-of-the-box solutions that address such configuration needs.
 *
 * <p>A BeanFactoryPostProcessor may interact with and modify bean
 * definitions, but never bean instances. Doing so may cause premature bean
 * instantiation, violating the container and causing unintended side-effects.
 * If bean instance interaction is required, consider implementing
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} instead.
